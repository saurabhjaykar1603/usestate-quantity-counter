### This code defines a React component named App that represents a product card. It takes three props: Title, cardImg, and Price, and manages the quantity of the product using the useState hook. The inc and dec functions increment and decrement the quantity while displaying alerts when the limits are reached. The component renders the product card with its details, quantity display, and buttons for quantity manipulation.
